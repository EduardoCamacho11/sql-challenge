# sql-challenge

I began this project by completing my schemata on QuickDBD.
Once I completed the schemata I exported it to postgresSQL.
I added all the data provided by the assingment to the tables created.
I was running into an issue on the first question due to labeling all the headers in my schemata with upper case letter. A tutor explain this to me and explained what i should do to make the rest of the process easier. 
The tutor suggest to go back to my schemata and make all the header start wiht lower case levels. 
The second question i knew i had to use a filter but was not getting an error. ChatGPT assisted me by directing me to add the Extract function.
In the third question i was running into another issue where i needed to join 3 tables together. ChatGPT assisted me on this question as well and demosntrated that i was able to do a first join and a seond join. 
In the fifth question i was also running into an issue becuase i was not able to filter trhough the data. I was  using  the wrong function. ChatGPT assisted me in explaining all the fucntion i was able to use with the filter function. 
In question number eight i was running into an issue becuase i was not able to figure out how to count the frequency. ChatGPT assisted me by explaining to me that i was able to use the group by function and the order by function.
